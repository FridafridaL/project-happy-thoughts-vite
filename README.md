# Happy Thoughts

This week the task was to practice react and fetching data from a API. I was suposed to build a version of twitter.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I went through the info on notion and the class. I found it hard to do the first move but when I had something in the browser it was a bit easier to go ahead.

I used google, notion and stack overflow.

I had some issues to make the responsive design follow through but with some testing back and forth i made it work.
